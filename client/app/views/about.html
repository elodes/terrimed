<p>Hello and Welcome to my website.  I hope that the information that you receive from my website will be helpful in helping you make a decision about addressing issues that you are facing.</p>
<p>Many people find the thought of going to a therapist as uncomfortable or having to disclose personal information to a total stranger as bothersome. Some people feel that they should be able to handle their own or a family members issues by themselves. Some thoughts might be “if only I was emotionally stronger then I wouldn’t have to rely on someone else.  I can just talk to my friend or family member to gain insight as to how address this issue. Unfortunately in our busy world family members and friends may be too busy with their own issues to help or may not have the tools to address your specific concerns.  To make matters worse our society often places a strong stigma on those individuals that seek counseling.</p>
<p>Feedback that I have received from clients is that they have found it helpful to have an outside confidential person to talk to and gain new insight, a different perspective or getting clarity on an issue that they have been struggling with for a long time.  “If only I had known that it was so helpful and supportive along with being enjoyable” I should have done this years ago, it’s like a heavy weight has been lifted off of my back.”  These are just a few comments that I have received from former clients.</p>
<p>My clients describe me as a warm, understanding and easy going individual that is easy to talk to. I went into counseling because I enjoy working with people and feel that I have a knack for helping them. I enjoy providing clients with tools so they can go on and lead productive lives.</p>
<p>Whether you are looking to make a significant change in your life, need some assistance with coping skills or need someone kind who will listen and be there for you!  At one time or another we all have needed help with learning how to cope with life’s challenges. Other times we may feel stuck in a situation and have difficulties taking the next important step.</p>
<p class="lead">Clients have shared with me that therapy is life altering. Sometimes it can be difficult and not always comfortable but the outcome of good therapy where there is a trusting relationship between the client and therapist means can mean growth and a positive change in one’s life.</p>
<p>I would be honored to work with you and make a positive contribution in your life. I am so glad that you have visited my website and hope you find the answers to your questions here. If you have any questions please call or e-mail me. I would be happy to discuss any questions your may have about the process. On behalf of Clarity Counseling Services, Welcome!</p>

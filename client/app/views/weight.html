<h2>Weight & Eating Issues</h2>

<p class="lead">At <abbr title="Clarity Counseling Services">CCS</abbr>, I work with clients to get to the root of their weight, self-image, or eating issues, rather than suggesting they
  change their behavior. </p>


<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    <p>I begin by working with clients to define what their issues are and when their problem behaviors are occurring. Together, we identify the negative messages
      that clients often unknowingly send to themselves which activate their problem behaviors.</p>
    <p>If you have lost and gained the same pounds numerous times, just going on a diet will not resolve the issue. Too often clients are placed on a diet
      without examining what the issues are and become frustrated with the results.</p>
    <p>At Clarity Counseling I focus on the underlying issues; not the symptoms. I work with clients to develop a personalized plan to move toward a
      healthier lifestyle.</p>

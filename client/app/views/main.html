          <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Terri, founder of Clarity Counseling Services in Champaign, Illinois. I'd like to personally invite you to read on, and learn more about me
            and the experience of seeing a counselor.</p>
          <p>Whether you are looking to make a significant change in your life, need some assistance with coping skills, or need someone kind who will listen and be there for you, I think counseling
            may be right for you.  At one time or another we all need help to cope with life’s challenges. Other times we feel stuck and have difficulty taking the next important step.</p>
          <p>Clients have shared with me that therapy is life altering. Sometimes it can be difficult and not always comfortable, but the outcome of good therapy where there is a trusting relationship
            between the client and therapist means growth and a positive change in one’s life.</p>
          <p>Many people think that going to a therapist may be uncomfortable, or that they should be able to handle their personal or family issues by themselves. You might think “if only I was emotionally stronger then I wouldn’t have to rely on someone else.  I can just talk to my friend or family member to gain insight as to how address this issue." Unfortunately in our busy world family members and friends are sometimes hard to talk to, or may not have the tools to address your specific concerns.  To make matters worse, our society sometimes places a strong stigma on those individuals that seek counseling.</p>
          <p>I'm familiar with the counseling process, and know that few people regret seeing a counselor. I've heard from clients that they found it helpful to have an outside, confidential person to talk to. They appreciated a different perspective or getting clarity on an issue that they have been struggling with for a long time. These are just a few comments that I have received from former clients:</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote"><em>"If only I had known all along that it would be so helpful and supportive, along with being enjoyable!"</em></blockquote>
          <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"><em>"I should have done this years ago. It’s like a heavy weight has been lifted off my back."</em></blockquote>

          <p>My clients describe me as a warm, understanding and easy-going individual that is easy to talk to. I went into counseling because I enjoy working with people and feel that I have a knack for helping them. I enjoy providing clients with tools so they can go on and lead productive lives. You can learn more about me <a href="#/terri">here.</a></p>

          <p>I would be honored to work with you and make a positive contribution in your life. I am so glad that you have visited my website and hope you find the answers to your questions here. If
            you have any questions please call or e-mail me. I would be happy to discuss any questions you may have about the therapy process. On behalf of <abbr title="Clarity Counseling Services">CCS</abbr>, Welcome!</p>

<h2>Therapy with Children & Adolescents</h2>
<p>At <abbr title="Clarity Counseling Services">CCS</abbr> I work with children and adolescents starting at age 3 and upward using play therapy for younger children. I have worked
  with different types of families including divorced, step/blended families, single parent families, gay or lesbian families,
  military families and families in transition and crisis situations. I begin by working with the family to define the goal of therapy for
  their child. An individual treatment plan is written for the family member, and we frequently review the plan to ensure that we are making progress.
  I do not push my ideas or values on families, but work with each family's own unique value system. I lay out various options and make
  recommendations, but I never forget that it is a parent's choice how to raise their own child.</p>

  <h3>Children</h3>
  Play therapy allows children to express and work through their emotions in a safe, warm, and nurturing environment.
  In addition to sessions with children, I will meet with parents and other family members as needed.</p>

<h3>Adolescents:</h3>
<p>At <abbr title="Clarity Counseling Services">CCS</abbr> I work with adolescents on a variety of issues that prevent them from being successful both at home and or school,
  including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ADHD</li>
  <li>Adoption</li>
  <li>Bullying</li>
  <li>Social Skills</li>
  <li>Anger Management</li>
  <li>Oppositional Defiance</li>
  <li>Eating Disorders</li>
  <li>Parent or Family Issues</li>
  <li>Self-Esteem</li>
  <li>Substance Abuse</li>
  <li>Depression</li>
  <li>Cutting/Self-Mutilation</li>
</ul>

<p>Adolescents experiencing any of these issues often have social and or academic difficulties in school and sometimes at home. Today’s teens are faced with many different
choices and are sent numerous messages as they interact with peers both inside and outside of the
  school setting. Often they have access to social media and information that parents are unaware of that can have a negative influence on them, and may get
  them into trouble. Teens are often faced with making difficult choices which are different from what they have been taught at home.</p>

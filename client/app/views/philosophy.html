    <h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p class="lead">Taking the steps to improve yourself, work on your relationship, or help your children is an important decision. It's wise to understand the
  process beforehand. Therapy will vary for each individual depending on their circumstances, past experiences and current concerns.</p>
<p> I provide clients a safe, comfortable and confidential environment in which to work through issues. If you find yourself repeating the same behaviors
  you may benefit from taking the time to examine those issues more closely to make a positive change.</p>
<p>Many times, through therapy, clients find new perspectives on how to view their current circumstances or relationships, and feel supported and
  empowered to make needed changes to become more self-confident individuals.</p>
<p>Life always isn’t fair and many times it’s really not very easy. We all stumble along the way, and we might not be able to control what exactly happens
  to us. But we <em>do</em> have control over how we react and cope with every situation.  As the old saying goes, “when life hands you lemons make lemonade”.</p>
<p>Clarity Counseling Service is based on the idea that various areas in one’s life can be brought together for positive change. Failure, dissatisfaction,
  and unhappiness in the past does not have to mean more of the same in the future. Clients have the opportunity to be heard and maximize their process of change
  during the therapy session. Each client has the ability to change. <strong>Together,</strong> the therapist and client are partners in change.</p>
